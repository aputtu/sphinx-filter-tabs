sphinx-filter-tabs: Accessible Filters
======================================

Welcome to the official documentation for ``sphinx-filter-tabs``.

This Sphinx extension provides a robust, accessible, and JavaScript-free way to create filterable content tabs. It's ideal for documentation that needs to present information for different contexts, such as programming languages, operating systems, or installation methods.

**Key Features:**

* **No JavaScript:** The filtering is achieved with pure CSS for speed and compatibility.
* **Accessible:** Follows WAI-ARIA best practices for keyboard navigation and screen readers.
* **Customizable:** Easily theme colors and styles directly from your ``conf.py``.
* **Graceful Fallback:** Renders as simple admonitions in non-HTML outputs like PDF/LaTeX.

You can find the project's source code on the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/aputtu/sphinx-filter-tabs>`_.
You can also download this documentation as a :download:`PDF file <_downloads/sphinxextension-filtertabs.pdf>`.
